Git operation

We have to decide which files and folders you DON'T wanna push up to you Git repository

Git has 2 flows:

- One is when we have a not git operated code:
    - "git init" command at the right folder -> it creates a hidden .git folder and detects all the folder it has to controll
    - we should decide which data should not go up to git (like paswords, user datas, virenv folders ...)
    - with .gitignore you can tell which folders or files you want git to AVOID
    - i have to initial commit -> this is the saved state

- One is when we hav a git operated code:
    - once I created a stage, i can commit ti
    - i will do and can do the commit
    - I create a remote branch on github and push my rea

    
    
first you create a change on your code (can be only 1 new caracter or line as well)
I would watch these changes: "git add"  ->
